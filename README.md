# Data analysis projects
The projects involve exploratory data analysis and machine learning through Python programming.
The basic goal involves loading and cleaning the data, defining the problem in order to transform the dataset into a useful format, analyzing the data, and drawing conclusions.
Further use of machine learning models are also being explored.
